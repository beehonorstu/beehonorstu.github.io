## Overview

**LogicCraft** is the ultimate destination for puzzle lovers. Designed carefully to push your deductive reasoning to its limits, the game offers hundreds of progressively difficult stages. Whether you have 5 minutes to spare on a commute or an hour to dive deep into complex logic, this game has the perfect puzzle for you.

## Features

- **Progressive Difficulty**: Starts with simple tutorials and scales into mind-bending grid puzzles.
- **Daily Challenges**: Fresh new puzzles every day to keep your brain active.
- **Clean UI**: A distraction-free, minimalist design focusing entirely on the puzzle mechanics.
- **Hint System**: Get subtle nudges in the right direction without spoiling the answer.

## The Challenge

Building a logic game requires a delicate balance between difficulty and frustration. The primary challenge was generating levels that were mathematically sound (having a single unique solution) while still being solvable by a human using logical deduction, rather than straight guesswork. 

## The Solution

We developed a custom puzzle generator algorithm that not only creates the grids but actively attempts to solve them using human-like strategies to ensure the difficulty curve feels natural and rewarding.
