## Overview

**Flick Wand** transforms the way you interact with your device. By allowing you to map complex actions and application launches to simple screen gestures, it eliminates the need to navigate through messy app drawers or multiple menus. It’s productivity at your fingertips.

## Features

- **Custom Gestures**: Draw letters, shapes, or simple swipes to trigger defined actions.
- **Deep Links & Shortcuts**: Instantly launch specific parts of apps (like "Send a message to Mom" or "Open calendar to today").
- **Low Resource Usage**: Runs silently in the background without draining your battery.
- **Floating Trigger**: A customizable, unobtrusive floating button to initiate the gesture pad instantly from anywhere.

## The Challenge

Android devices vary wildly in screen sizes, resolutions, and system overlays. Creating a gesture recognition system that was both highly accurate and universally compatible across different OEM skins required significant optimization.

## The Solution

We implemented a robust machine-learning-assisted stroke recognition engine. It learns your specific drawing style over time, ensuring that your "flick" is always recognized correctly, even if you are in a rush.
